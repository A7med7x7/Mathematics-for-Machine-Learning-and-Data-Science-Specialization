Here is the solution for the math specialization of Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization.

### Notes 
I took these tests in October 2023 and finished them before the year 2024. However, I was only able to receive my certificate for Calculus and Statistics after 10 months due to problems submitting my code solution with the grader. Although I passed the tests, the final grading didn't work, and I believe others may face similar issues in the future. Here is a list of the problems I encountered and how to overcome them; you will probably find some of them.

- **You are submitting a version of the assignment that is behind the latest version:**
    - The latest version is 2 and you are on version 1.
    - To upgrade to the latest version, follow the instructions in the reading item called '(Optional) Common Coursera Labs Operations'.
    - This item can be found before the assignment of the first week of the course.
    - This notebook should be up to date, so create a copy of it in your drive, migrate your work to this newer version, and submit again for grading.

- **A comment is lost list your code start here:**
  - Usually you should write the code between the stated comments
  - You many face a problem if the grader couldn't find the comment, I struggled to know that #Q$ may be a comment that stats the question no.4, deleting it will brone the grader to falsify 
  I added a new line.
